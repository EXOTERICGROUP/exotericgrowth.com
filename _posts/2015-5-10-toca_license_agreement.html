    <h2>TOCAVISION VIDEO EXPERIENCE DIGITAL VIDEO LICENSE AGREEMENT</h2>
    <p> This Digital Video License Agreement (the “Agreement”), effective as of 
      <input type="date" /> (the “Effective Date”), is made and entered into by and between 
    <li><input placeholder="Toca Boca, Inc." /> a company registered in California, USA</li>
    <li>with registered office at <input placeholder="Address" /> (the “LICENSEE”);
     <li> and you <input placeholder="Your Name" /> A Company Name and Type or Individual located at <input placeholder="Address" />
     (the “Content Provider"); </li>
     <ol>
  <li>
    <h4>Interpretation</h4>
    <dl>
      <dt><dfn>LICENSEE</dfn> means</dt>
      
      <dd>Toca Boca, Inc. individually, effective upon the date each entity executes this Agreement: (a) and (b) any other affiliate that joins as a party to this Agreement as provided in Section 5.</dd>

      <dt><dfn>CONTENT PROVIDER</dfn> means</dt>
      
      <dd>You, the party providing content to LICENSEE.</dd>

      <dt><dfn>FIXED FEE</dfn> means</dt>
      
      <dd>THIS AGREEMENT IS FOR A FIXED FEE - WHY? - ITS SIMPLE, STRAIGHT FORWARD and BEST FOR BOTH PARTIES!
      Probably the simplest way to structure license fees (otherwise referred to as royalties) is through a fixed fee payment. Under such a model, the licensee pays a set amount determined at the time the agreement is signed. A benefit of the fixed fee to the licensor is the certainty of revenue either up front or at predetermined installment dates. From the perspectives of both licensor and licensee, there is the advantage of not having to track royalty payment. </dd>

     <dt><dfn>INITIAL TERM</dfn> means </dt>
     
     <dd>Three years from the date of the signing of the agreement. Why three years? We are making an investment in your content through upfront payment, we need the security of having a set amount of time to run the content in order to recoup the value.  Additionally as this is second run (past release) content that is publicly available on other media sources, and this is a non-exclusive agreement we think its fair to ask for.</dd>
     
     <dt><dfn>RENEWAL TERM</dfn> means </dt>
    
     <dd>Each Renewal Term extends rights to distribution for an additional twelve "12" Months after the expiration of the initial three "3" year term.</dd>

     <dt><dfn>TERM</dfn> means </dt>
     <dd>The Term is the Initial Term plus each Renewal Term.</dd>
     
     <dt><dfn>TERRITORY</dfn> means </dt>
     <dd>The Geographic Regions for which License apply.</dd>
     
     <dt><dfn>SERVICE</dfn> means </dt>
    <dd>The Toca Boca Service is... </dd>
     
     <dt><dfn>NON-TRANSACTIONAL ACCESS</dfn> means </dt>
     <dd> Subscription video on demand (SVOD).  Allows for a digital access of the content in which consumers are charged monthly fees in return for accessing the platforms full library. access digital copies of audio-video content on a subscription basis, including on a subscription basis supported by ads, free-on-demand basis or via other non-transactional basis for electronic delivery and repeated viewing during the Term</dd>

     <dt><dfn>WHY?</dfn> means</dt>
     <dd> Why both Ad Supported Access and Non-Transactional (SVOD)?While we never intend to run advertisements in our mobile product it is possible that distribution of our experience extends to platforms that have ads in the future.  This provision is here to protect against the need to renegotiate in the unlikely event that this happens and provides additional revenue to you if it does.</dd>

     <dt><dfn> License Fees</dfn> means </dt>
     <dd>The Monetary Compensation you receive based on Exhibit A where each accepted Video will be licensed for the Term for $1.00 per minute of footage accepted </dd> </dl>

<list="list-style: none"><i>For the purposes of calculating License Fee payments, </i></li>

<p>a. LICENSEE will not be obligated to pay License Fees for Ad-supported Access in connection with the viewing of any Title by a customer if that customer was granted access to that Title via Non-transactional Access. </p>

<p>b. As between the Parties, "LICENSEE" will be solely responsible for collecting and paying to the appropriate taxing authorities any national, state or local sales or use taxes, value added taxes (“VAT”) or similar taxes (collectively “Transaction Taxes”) applicable to purchases by "Customers". </p>

<p>c. "LICENSEE" will not be required to pay any taxes imposed on or measured by "CONTENT PROVIDER"'s' net income, net profits, income, profits, revenues, gross receipts, franchise, doing business, capital, intangible, value added (other than value added tax in the nature of sales or use or similar taxes), net worth, all real property and value added taxes imposed by any governmental authority on the fees payable to Content Provider under this Agreement, or similar taxes or taxes in lieu thereof, whether collected by withholding or otherwise.</p> 

<p>d. All payments payable by "LICENSEE" to "Content Provider" under this Agreement are inclusive of all Transaction Taxes that apply to the license of the Titles by Content Provider to LICENSEE. If and to the extent any payments hereunder are subject to and include any applicable Transaction Taxes, Content Provider will supply LICENSEE with an original, valid tax invoice, to the extent available under the applicable law, separately stating these Transaction Taxes, to enable LICENSEE to claim credit for these taxes as applicable. </p>

<p>e. "LICENSEE" may provide "CONTENT PROVIDER" with an exemption certificate or equivalent information acceptable to the relevant taxing authority, in which case, "Content Provider" will not charge or collect the Taxes covered by such certificate.

<p>   i. deduct such taxes from the amount owed to Content Provider and pay them to the appropriate taxing authority as required by applicable law and </p>

<p>   ii. secure and deliver to Content Provider a receipt or other legally required documentation for any taxes withheld as required under applicable laws. Payment to Content Provider as reduced by such deductions or withholdings will constitute full payment and settlement to Content Provider of amounts payable under this Agreement.

<p> f. Throughout the term of this Agreement, Content Provider will provide LICENSEE with any forms, documents or other certifications as may be required by LICENSEE to satisfy any information reporting or withholding tax obligations with respect to any payments under this Agreement.</p>
